# A_Stolen_Identity

Website by Jeanette Wells

A Stolen Identity is an interactive web-based narrative created using Adobe Photoshop and coded in html. The work was created to depict my fatherâ€™s point of view during his battle with ALS, describing the loss of life in the two years it took him to fade from his diagnosis to nothing. Stripped of his voice, independence, and his entire identity, this site, in its simple interactions and ghostly lines, guides viewers on a path similar to his. Meant to be ambiguous and discreet, the work uses various childhood images of my father that I digitally manipulated. A messy disease brought chaos to not only his life, but our entire family, and this narrative brings a sense of understanding of the situation. This work enables me to talk about the limitations and devastations of his illness without outwardly describing so to viewers.
